# SQL Database Project 

In this project I utilized MS SQL Server Express 2015 to create a Relational Database Model for a Library Management System.
The SQL file has stored procedures that gather specific information. The individual requirements are notated above each respective procedure.
Included in this commit are the .mdf file and _log.ldf.
