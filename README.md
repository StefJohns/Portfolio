This is a portfolio of my best work.

# SQL Database Project 

In this project I utilized MS SQL Server Express 2015 to create a Relational Database Model for a Library Management System.
The SQL file has stored procedures that gather specific information. The individual requirements are notated above each respective procedure.
Included in this commit are the .mdf file and _log.ldf.

# A Pure Photo Gallery

In this project I created a photo gallery utilizing only HTML5 and CSS3.
This is based on a project I did while at The Tech Academy. I changed the UI during the project to learn theming and cohesion.
I also tried a glow animation for the first time on the navigation buttons.

# Build A Pizza using KnockoutJS

This project was used to learn KnockoutJS. I created a non functioning pizza menu, with a customized theme and layout in order to create a pizza. This was done as an ASP.NET Single Page Application. Though you do not get a price or even delivery, you get to pretend to build a pizza!
